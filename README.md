# Blockless

Have you ever been forced to destroy and rebuild yourself to adapt to a challenging situation?

Have you ever has to think out of the box to see around?

This game is about this. There are 15 one-screen challenges to prove yourself and this concept. Try to build your way starting with nothing. Hope you enjoy it and have fun!



I'm open to criticism, thank's for playing!

# Controls
WASD to move + mouse (left and right) to build/destroy blocks

# Source code
There's all on my GitHub, fell free to check it out!

# Assets
It's all made by me, except for font (credits for Raymond Larabie) and player controller (not yet!!)

# Looking ahead
Why not a multiplayer and big scenarious with lots of puzzles each one? Let me know if you think it deserves it!
